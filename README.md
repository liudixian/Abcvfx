**Abcvfx** is a Unity package that allows using an [Alembic] animation as a VFX
source.

MeshBaker Component
-------------------

**MeshBaker** is a Unity component that converts an animating mesh into an
animating point cloud. It not only bakes vertex positions and normals but also
vertex colors from a given texture.

It also supports a [HAP video texture], which is useful for rendering a
volumetric video like [4DViews].

You can bind a baked point cloud to a VFX component using
**VFXBakedMeshBinder**.
